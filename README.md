# UncertainEarth

TO-DO:
* add basic walk-through script
* assess timestep size sensitivity of starting T for each beta
* change starting T to be curve-by-curve instead of splitting difference?
* consolidate figure 6 scripts into one script w/two input files
* expand beta range for starting T to minimize interpolation-out-of-bounds error

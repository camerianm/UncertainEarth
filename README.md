# UncertainEarth

TO-DO:
* add basic walk-through script
* add plot to generate_figures: PDF(Z), PDF(Z=n)/PDF(Z=0)
* ensure sample temperature trajectories are up-to-date, and only one CSV
* assess timestep size sensitivity of starting T for each beta
* change starting T to be curve-by-curve instead of splitting difference?
* consolidate figure 6 scripts into one script w/two input files
